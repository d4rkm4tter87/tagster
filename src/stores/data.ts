In most rule sets a group is dead if its eyespace can be reduced to this shape. The reasoning behind that is, that the attacker can start a ko any time while the defender has no move to prevent that. So theoretically, the attacker can finish the game and start the ko when there are no more helpful ko threats for the defender.",
